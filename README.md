## bootstrap replay evaluation for epsilon decay and annealing SoftMax and its application for creating systems that use data intelligently to improve themselves.
### To design technology that impacts people – in education, health, business – creating systems that use data intelligently to improve themselves. This requires combining human intelligence (using methods like crowdsourcing, collaborative design) with artificial intelligence (discovering which technology designs help which people) through designing randomized A/B experiments that are collaborative, dynamic, and personalized.
